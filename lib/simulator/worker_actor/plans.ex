  Module contataining Worker's functions responsible for the plans.

  Each plan is a tensor: [direction, action, consequence].

  `direction` - a plan contains an action towards a specific
    neighboring cell. `Direction` indicates it.

  `action` - what should be the state of the target cell (pointed by
    `direction`).

  `consequence` - what should be in the current cell if the plan will
    be executed.

  Example: a person wants to move up: [@dir_up, @person, @empty].
